# Kat

Kat, the Keycloak Analysis Tool, assists with understanding the workings of Keycloak.

Kat provides information about the Keycloak database structure.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'kat'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install kat

## Usage

To test processing of an SQL file generated by a myPhpAdmin export of the
structure (not including the data), use the following command.

    $ kat read keycloak.sql

where keycloak.sql is the SQL file generated by myPhpAdmin. If no errors are
encountered, kat will display the number of tables and constraints found.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
